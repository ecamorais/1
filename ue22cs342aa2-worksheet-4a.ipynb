The company wants to test product recommendations and improve their product catalogue. For this exercise, you are tasked with the analysis of User Ratings for Health and Personal Care Products.\n\n\n\n# Details of the dataset:\n\n### Columns in this dataset:\n\n- 'sl': serial number of records\n\n- 'user_id': Unique identifier for users\n\n- 'title': title of the review\n\n- 'text': body of the review\n\n- 'asin': Amazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN) is a ten-digit alphanumeric code that identifies products on Amazon. It's unique for each product and is assigned when you create a new product in Amazon's catalog.\n\n- 'parent_asin': The abstraction of the variations is called the parent ASIN. It can't be purchased and hence is not associated with an offer.\n\n- 'rating': Product rating (out of 5)\n\n- 'timestamp': In milliseconds\n\n- 'helpful_vote': Interactions of other users with this review\n\n- 'verified_purchase': (True or False) Amazon has verified that the person writing the review purchased the product from Amazon, and didn't receive the product at a discount.\n\n\n\n## Some conceptual information:\n\n### Utility Matrix\n\nThis is an m x n matrix (m users, n items) that consists the rating / preference of each user for each item.\n\nIt is usually quite sparse as the rating values are usually present for very few user-item pairs.\n\n\n\n### Neighborhood-based methods\n\nThe main idea with neighborhood-based methods is to leverage either user-user similarity or item-item similarity to make recommendations. These methods assume that similar users tend to have similar behaviors when rating items.\n\nThere are mainly two types:\n\n\n\n1. **User-based collaborative filtering**: based on similarity between users.\n\n2. **Item-based collaborative filtering**: based on similarity between items.\n\n\n\n### Matrix factorization/decomposition\n\nThe utility matrix can be represented as a product of two smaller matrices, say U and V, representing users and items respectively.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Install the required packages","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#install.packages(\"recommenderlab\")\n\n#install.packages(\"tidyr\")","metadata":{"vscode":{"languageId":"plaintext"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Load the required packages","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# library(dplyr)\n\n# library(tidyr)   \n\n# library(recommenderlab)\n\n# library(ggplot2)","metadata":{"vscode":{"languageId":"plaintext"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Load and create dataframe","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Your code here","metadata":{"vscode":{"languageId":"plaintext"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Perform EDA and Preprocess the dataset to the required format\n\n### 1 point\n\nState some observations that you made after performing EDA.\n\nFeel free to remove any columns you think are not necessary for the following problems.\n\nSome hints to help you get started:\n- Check the summary, number of rows and columns\n- Remove null values and duplicates\n- Obtain a subset of the dataset with the required columns only.\n- Create the utility matrix\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Your code here","metadata":{"vscode":{"languageId":"plaintext"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Problem 1\n\n### User-based collaborative filtering: 3 points (2+1)\n\n1.
